This project, titled **CSS_GRID**, demonstrates the use of CSS Grid across five HTML pages, each presenting structured data for various categories: employees, actors, students, animals, and products. The grid layout is utilized on each page to organize and display information such as employee IDs and salaries, actor profiles, student courses, animal classifications, and product details. Built with HTML and CSS, the project highlights the flexibility of CSS Grid in visually arranging data. Users can easily clone the repository, modify the datasets, and view the layouts by opening the HTML files in a browser. A detailed README is included, outlining the project's structure, technologies used, and providing instructions for usage and contributions.
